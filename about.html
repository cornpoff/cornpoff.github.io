			<p>I'm <b>J Wu</b>! I like to draw things with a simple and cute flavor. I hope to portray stories with LGBTQ themes about self-expression, companionship, and the discovery of one's role in the universe. &#127776;

			<span>▲ some time during summer 2021, i got really excited to learn how to 3d model a lowpoly character, and i picked sesame and sat down to watch a series of japanese blender tutorials on how to make "lowpoly anime". my first attempt was not so great (i like to call it "depressed sesame") but my second attempt is shown above! the <a href="images/999.gif">new</a> sesame is much nicer. after that, i had to wrestle with rigging, rendering, posing... _ :(´ཀ`」 ∠):_ 
			<br>anyway, i'm so attached to sesame now that they became my mascot character</span>

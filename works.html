		<br><br>As part of a team of 3, I drew character art and concepts, UI art and design, and helped develop the game and story concepts. Please check out the rest of the <a href="https://cafe-nemo.itch.io/">team</a> as well!

			▲ i truly had a blast working on citc! it's closest to working on a dream (heh) game, except it was just the three of us and we had a 1 month time limit. i did all non-background art assets, while cynthia and tina were doing major heavy lifting with the code and everything. o(￣┰￣*)ゞ but we all brainstormed visual and story concepts. it's amazing how it all came together. 
			<br>i'm glad i got to draw so much of somnia and remerie! they are Girlfriends

			▲ when you click on the menu in the first image, it slides over and changes the entire background to the second image. the food and mist on the respective screens are also animated to gently float! this is all thanks to tina and cynthia's genius!!!
			<br>also, i enjoyed drawing remerie's backside. the in-game sprite is forward facing, so you usually don't get to see her cute apron bow.

			▲ somehow we arrived at "dream-eating baku bakers" during the initial brainstorm session, and we collectively jumped on this idea. there were many fun brainstorming sessions for every bit of the game, from the character designs to the UI to the gameplay flow during the game's different phases. it feels like i'm looking at baby pictures.

			▲ the teal sprites are for the incredible dream sequence. please play the game to see this gameplay in action! it's the heart of the game, with tina programming this whole section for a fantastic gameplay experience and cynthia's otherworldly background and object art. my tiny sprites can't do it justice!
